* [ ] All puzzle logic can go into /controllers/sudoku-solver.js
    * [ ] The validate function should take a given puzzle string and check it to see if it has 81 valid characters for the input.
    * [ ] The check functions should be validating against the current state of the board.
    * [ ] The solve function should handle solving any given valid puzzle string, not just the test inputs and solutions. You are expected to write out the logic to solve this.
* [ ] All routing logic can go into /routes/api.js
* [ ] See the puzzle-strings.js file in /controllers for some sample puzzles your application should solve
* [ ] To run the challenge tests on this page, set NODE_ENV to test without quotes in the .env file
* [ ] To run the tests in the console, use the command npm run test. To open the Replit console, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd if on a Mac) and type "open shell"
